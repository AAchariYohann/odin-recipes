        <h3>Why you'll love it</h3>
            <p>This tuna garlic pasta recipe takes me back to my childhood. My mom used to make something similar when I was a kid, and I just loved it. I’ve even made this with just tuna, garlic, and olive oil when I’m in a rush and I really have nothing in the fridge.I never put this recipe on the blog because I wasn’t sure people would like it even though I know it tastes great. I did a little research, and there definitely is demand for canned tuna pasta, so I figured I’d do it! If you’re busy with after school activities, this tuna spaghetti recipe is one way to save some time and keep your sanity.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta: I use penne</li>
            <li>Olive oil: for the base of the sauce</li>
            <li>Garlic: use even more than suggested if you’re a big fan. I like using a garlic press to easily mince the cloves.</li>
            <li>Tuna: the star of this inexpensive pasta recipe! I recommend using a can of tuna packed in oil for maximum flavor.</li>
            <li>Lemon juice: for a pop of acidity and brightness</li>
            <li>Parsley: a little freshness and herb flavor</li>
        
        </ul>  
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta until al dente. Meanwhile, prep the other ingredients. When the pasta is almost done, heat up the oil in a saucepan. Once hot, add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Stir in the tuna, lemon juice, and chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Let it heat through. Once the pasta is done, drain it, reserving some of the pasta water. Add a couple of tablespoons of it to the sauce. Toss the spaghetti with the sauce, and season with salt & pepper as needed.</li>
        </ol>
